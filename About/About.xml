Allows you to set the threat scale, in theory, as high as you want. How high will it let you go? I don't know. You can also increase the threat points cap (the game normally caps at 10,000) or even uncap it entirely.

Use at your own risk though because there are no checks and balances and your game will behave accordingly. If you decide to uncap threat points and start a game with 1M% threat scale, don't be surprised if your game crashes before anyone has a chance to kill you.

Speaking of threat points, if you're curious about how many threat points the game is using for each raid, check out my other mod: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2562730174

Note: This version of the mod is compatible with the Visible Raid Points mod's threat points breakdown feature, but as a result, any changes to this mod's settings require a game restart in order to take effect. You will also need to download the compatibility version of Visible Raid Points from the "uts-compatibility" branch on GitHub: https://github.com/1trickPwnyta/VisibleRaidPoints/tree/uts-compatibility

=== Updates ===
08/09/2021: Added support for version 1.2.
